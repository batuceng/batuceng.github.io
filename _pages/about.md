I am a Master's Student and a Research Assistant at the [Istanbul Technical University](https://ituvisionlab.github.io/), supervised by [Gozde Unal](https://gozde-unal.github.io/). I received my Bachelor's also from  Istanbul Technical University. My main research is focused on 3D Vision, robustness and generative models.
